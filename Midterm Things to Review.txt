Hardware:
- MOSFET choice seems overkill
- Justify circuitry from solar car (can't just say we know it works)
- Inductor might be overly chonk
- Maybe justify testpoint selections
Softare:
- Read up on libraries we are using (rpi interrupts, rpi camera, aws s3)
- Be able to explain how PREEMPT_RT kernel patch works
